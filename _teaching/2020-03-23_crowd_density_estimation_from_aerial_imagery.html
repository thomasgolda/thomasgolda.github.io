Crowd counting in aerial imagery has just recently gained the attention of researches with initial datasets emerging. Therefore, this work also tackles this setting, but since previous work mostly focuses on the single image case, the case of video sequences is considered here with a greater emphasis. 
Such sequences namely exhibit temporal dependencies that are to be incorporated within the decision making process and could potentially yield more accurate estimates. The remainder of this work is structured as follows: First the fundamentals necessary to follow along this work are presented. Then the related work regarding crowd counting, as well as the used datasets are intrdocued. Own ideas are then presented and subsequently evaluated. Lastly, a final conclusion of this work is given in the last chapter.
