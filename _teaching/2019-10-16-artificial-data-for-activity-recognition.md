Video-based activity recognition is a research field of broad interest. There exists a variety of methods that tackle this problem, most of which are working directly on image data. However, artificial / synthetic data have already proven their value for various tasks in machine learning. Kristina is therefore ivestigating whether such data can also be applied to the problem of activity recognition.
